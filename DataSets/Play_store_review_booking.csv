Google Play,Booking.com,Nicci J,Easy to navigate and brilliant for booking. Easy for communication with proprietors of properties. I particularly like the translation option for bookings abroad. The ability to cancel prior to stays is excellent as you never know what might happen. We've been caught out a few times and saved £££ with the cancellation option. All in all a very satisfactory app.,5,209,2023-12-31 23:19:05,"Thank you for your words and review, Nicci.

Google Play,Booking.com,Kathryn Lambkin,"The best place to book hotels. I've stayed in hotels for 90 days out of the last 365 so I know what I'm talking about! Filtering by keywords in reviews really helps you select the most affordable but least dodgy property! I'm at genius level 3, so I get a discount off almost every booking. Always the cheapest worldwide. Please add a filter for lift/elevator (Expedia has this under accessibility) I suggest users filter reviews by most recent. Check for noise and poor maintenance of rooms.",5,166,2024-01-02 06:38:12,"Thank you for your words and review, Kathryn.

Google Play,Booking.com,Kei,"The app itself and when trips are booked without a problem, it's not an issue. But if there is an issue with your trip, good luck.. Their support agents are so siloed, you get pinged around different agents after every interaction. I have had to repeat myself 6 times to 6 different people. EXTREMELY frustrating.

Google Play,Booking.com,Michael Crutchfield,"Pretty decent app. For the most part it does everything it's supposed to do ^_^ I would really love to see a button along the bottom or some kind of shortcut to view my messages/correspondence from booked hotels. At the moment you have to go to the saved booking and click send a new message, it's not intuitive, and a bunch of extra clicks to get to that area. Otherwise no issues with the app at all.",4,1381,2023-10-25 13:45:56,"Hi Michael and thank you for getting in touch about that. Our Team is aware of the situation and we are currently working on it.

Google Play,Booking.com,Stefan Gamboa,"Terrible costumer service. I spend like 3 days emailing with a few costumer service agents because I want to cancel a reservation and I can't, I literally can't find any cancelation option in my reservation. They didn't help me at all. All of them told me (like robots) to go to the confirmation Email and look for the option, but IT'S NOT THERE and that's what I'm trying to say.

They have made all efforts to be uncontactable when trying to speak to a human, with no phone option, no email, no live chat option, and only a message function. Even then, when replying it sends you to different agents who have little ability to help (not the agents fault, entirely the company's fault).

Husband's name spelt wrongly on booking, not discounted my genius level discount and charged a commission because I paid in euros to a Spanish airline (I live in Spain) have been on to their customer service during the last 4 weeks and am still asking the same questions.

They designed thier help service as hard as it can be. You can only contact the hotel but if the issue is about to them its gonna be a hell. This company should establish a easy way to contact them.

Client must then pay extra at the hotel. Also prevents screen shots to show the defect to customer support.

I would not recommend it to anyone who cares about completely losing a saved international flight credit through an airline. This company, despite what the airline says and confirms, does not care about taking away a customer's rightful flight credit.

Google Play,Booking.com,Dan S,"The app isn't horrible to use, hidden fees don't appear until you are ready to pay. These can add 50% or more to the price. Also, it won't let you take a screenshot of the price so if they later charge you more, or the place has no hot tub as advertised, you have no recourse. Why are screenshots a problem? Are they afraid you might post all their hidden fees on social media or is it some other bait and switch tactic? Screenshots are a quick way to record relevant info, why block them?",1,19,2023-10-21 22:21:17,"Thank you for sharing your feedback, Dan S.

My only concern is that when you want to search the address of the hotel, 1) you cannot use the map to get directions from point A to the hotel, say, a bus terminal for example, and 2) you cannot copy and paste the address at all from underneath the map into Google Maps. Your app does not allow this at all. Both of these make it very difficult to organise any sort of transport to get from your point of arrival to the hotel.",4,373,2023-02-08 15:32:45,,,35.3

The hotel canceled my stay in order not to receive a bad review and I contacted the customer service in order to solve that. I've also seen that the hotel has 2 different entries, and I told that to the customer support, but they refused to help me and they insisted to assume that the hotel was telling the truth about my stay! So overall, even if the platform is good if you're lucky, if you're in need of the Customer Support, I'm already feeling bad for you. Hope for the platform to revise some of their customer support policies, because this is truly unacceptable!! UPDATE: After the reply of the customer support that you can see below, I've spent some time looking for a number to call the customer service, and it seems that there is no phone contact details.. Worst reply ever to an unsatisfied customer..

Google Play,Booking.com,Chris Friedman,"It's good for last minute searching, could use a little more options. Overall though it's a good go to. Some people just want particular things while traveling to sort through, laundry facilities wasn't a selectable option unless I missed it, but I'm also road worn and can easily miss such a option. Last time I used Booking it missed the details I specifically was looking for. I see many more options now and hopefully it's on point this time.",4,331,2022-12-02 22:06:48,,,34.6
Google Play,Booking.com,Jo Mosley,"Booking is the best app for wanderers like me, who are not likely to know exactly where or when the day will end until at least half way through the day. Heck, that river we just drove by has some falls we will stop to hike 5 miles to see. It may be so nice we stay for a few hours or even camp. This means a lot of booking ""just in case"" places along the route with free cancellations, and booking provides date/time on account and helps if needed. Also, last minute stays are always a deal!",5,0,2023-08-13 14:33:53,,,

Google Play,Booking.com,Hazel Ford,Used to be good but the map option has recently disappeared from the top options (now just 'sort' and 'filter'). This means you have to search for each property separately in a different app to find out where they are.

Google Play,Booking.com,El Mehdi Zeroual,I made a reservation 3 months ago with a low price with the choice of payment at the hotel and free cancelation before 6th August. On 4th of August my reservation was canceled with the reason that no payment was made. I contacted the hotel that confirmed they never had a reservation with my name and of course booking didn't reply to my emails asking for answers. (The prices are at least 4 times higher when rechecked for another reservation at the same hotel). This is the last time am using this,1,167,2022-08-07 06:02:40,"That sounds like a case for our Customer Service team. Have you tried to contact us, El Mehdi Zeroual?

Now I am being overcharged for a hotel room that I don't even want anymore. Just call the hotel next time. It's easier and costs less. Too much to look at on the app. If people want to learn about the amenities, make a different tab for that. Instead of throwing a bunch of useless stuff in their face. I wanted a nice hotel room, with a pool. Then if you dont LOOK for it it won't tell you but you'll get charged a security deposit. Then the hotels pool was closed, not their fault but still I would have been highly disappointed. Now I am stuck with a hotel room that I do not want.

Google Play,Booking.com,A Google user,Cannot find a way to exclude dorm rooms anymore. Even if you exclude hostels in the filter a lot of dorm rooms are classified as b&b or hotels so results are still saturated with dorms meaning the price on the front screen is not representive of room cost. Makes using the app very difficult and as a result I have resorted to using an app that allows me to search and filter rooms not beds.
