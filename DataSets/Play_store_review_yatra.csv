Google Play,com.yatra.base,TOMIN JOHN JOHNSON,I made a huge mistake by installing this app. I booked my ticket from banglore to Cochin using this app. The flight (spicejet) preponded the timing from 5:30pm to 2:15pm and this timing was not at all comfortable for me and I cancelled the ticket calling spicejet. They promised me to pay back the full refund amount. Since I didn't recieved the money I called back spicejet they told me that the full amount is already refunded to yatra. From that not even a single penny is refunded to me.,1,9,2020-09-21 19:57:56,"Dear Customer, your issue has been escalated to the concerned team and they are working on it.

Google Play,com.yatra.base,nikhil malik,Fraudsters. Used their fare drop policy. Instead of automatically providing refund for excess fare they didn't even accept that the fare has dropped and they should pay for the excess fare. After a long trail of 15 days on email they come up with a solution that I should share the fare details again by going on the flight review page. Even a child knows that air fares are dynamic and 15 days more nearer to the journey date the fare would definitely have increased.
