After arguing with custome care they refund back the amount to Oyo wallet and not the original mode of payment. Next time when you try to book you can't use the wallet money, customer care asks you to pay separately. There's no point escalating as well. Nothing is done This is my second such experience.

In that they calculated total for 3 adults including breakfast and lunch or dinner. But when we reached at hotel they said that this amount is only for 2 adults. We have to pay extra person's amount. We paid it not because we have lost of money but as property is very nice and we had experienced it last time so we paid extra person's amount.so I just don't want to book anymore with this useless company.,1,11,2023-12-12 14:23:46,"We would love to help you out with this, please share details at https://go.ibi.bo/NM3evpGbtFb (Do note that to access this link, you will have to check for a mail from noreply@google.com on your registered e-mail ID on playstore).

Google Play,Goibibo,vinesh reddy,It shows better price compared to other apps or official flight websites. But you will face trouble when you want to calcel or reschedule or change any details. I bought an travel insurance but flight got rescheduled now goibibo is not taking responsibility for insurance date changes or cancel the insurance. They are saying the insurance is not refundable. What we need to do as a user if flight got rescheduled?

If you ever planning to book a ticket under the goConfirmed scheme please don't make the mistake of booking two or more waitlist tickets from the same account rather use two different accounts.If you book two or more waitlist tickets under the scheme they will simply trick you by confirming one ticket and keeping the other ticket in waitlist.This will benefit them as their schemes doesn't return the 2X amount of the ticket fare if one is confirmed,1,4,2023-08-04 23:13:44,"For us to help, please share details at https://go.ibi.bo/dD12HNgu0Bb (Do note that to access this link, you will have to check for a mail from noreply@google.com on your registered e-mail ID on playstore).

Google Play,Goibibo,A Google user,I had been using this app quiet sometime. What I noticed is that.. They add extra taxes and discount it. What's the point? 🤔 They make it look like it's a great discount. It's the same or sometimes more than others have. And.. The price alert notification cannot be disabled. I had been trying to disable notifications.. Not happening! The reason for 3 stars is that these people have some good hotels that are not in other sites.

I've exhausted all other avenues suggested by goibibo.

Didn't refund nor compensated. This was the 1st & only time I've used them.

I ended up having to go to the goair office and changing it there, hence had to pay twice. I have no yet been refunded even though I have e-mailed proof. There is no way to speak to customer care as there's no one who speaks to you. Most of the numbers given are invalid anyway. Honestly, what a waste of time and money.",1,67,2020-12-12 13:01:32,Thank you for reaching out to us.

Google Play,Goibibo,Gagan Mittal,Worse customer service experience. They do not bother to try resolving problems. They choose greed of more business over customer preference by trying to adjust for travel voucher instead of refund when airlines is refunding. They receive refund and do not even transfer and keep the customer harassed with no communication. Please use other portals where there is atleast 2 way communication. Also can't believe this is linked to MMT where customer service is much better.,1,0,2020-10-17 10:08:22,Thank you for reaching out to us.

Google Play,Goibibo,A Google user,"Had horrible expirience with goibibo and issue still not sorted. They booked onward ticket without passport and stating for backward i Need passport. My booking in is next year and I have applied for passport. I checked from both the airlines if Passport needed for booking and they said no and then only I went ahead. Goibibo being middlemen between consumer and airline, imposing their own rules which makes no sense and holding my booking. If Passport is a must how did they confirm onward booking and issued ticket. Customer care is absolutely not helpful. Even after all this no solution yet. Now they are trying to cheat me by falsely telling price hike. App shows same Price. Also I did another booking along with this one. And the same was confirmed today without any hike.

It's been 70 days I cancelled the trip still not received the amount back. Whenever we call customer care same reply we need 24 hrs to resolve and still no response at all. Don't install or book with this app. Worst customer service.,1,2,2022-06-30 21:52:27,"Your support means the world to us. Keep booking & safe travels.

I recommend to everyone that don't download this app and book anything otherwise you will pay hefty loss. Their cancellation policy is worst too. They are only trying to looting money from people and not even providing good services. After using this app I prefer going on foot then booking any travel service from this app.💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩,1,14,2023-01-20 13:52:05,"Hi Sir , We are very sorry for the problems that you faced while booking flight tickets with us.

Google Play,Goibibo,vaibhav wahi,I booked my tickets from the app and now they have some tech issue and have not paid the airline. The airline has been calling me for payment or they will cancel my ticket. I have already paid Goibibo. No cust care number is working not even email. They will not even read this review and send a standard reply with a link to my trip section that is useless and numbers that only have IVR that redirect to my trip section. It is an endless loop.,1,22,2020-12-25 11:19:29,"

From that time, trying for the refund of my debited money and all the attempts were useless as the Goibibo didn't value their customers.

Google Play,Goibibo,A Google user,I hate your app as it has caused me loss.The calendar UI should not show 3 months nor should the app retain last searched date when someone starts the app again. I ended up booking the wrong month because I had previously searched the same flight but for March 2020 and that remained the default month instead of Current Month in my fresh search. I simply selected the date and booked the ticket and had to cancel it. Will never use this app ever again for booking.

I cannot even contact the customer service.,1,118,2023-06-12 11:47:19,"We want to look into this right away, please share details of your grievance at this unique customer link (Please note that to access this link, you will have to check it on your registered e-mail ID).

Worst and most irritating part is customer support. You can't contact for any queries or complaints. Not recommended👎 Pathetic service. Fraud app. Don't use this fake and useless application. It's really sad to see someone is taking your hardly earned money without giving any services.

Google Play,Goibibo,reshma kamath,"I have been trying to reach the customer care via call or email or even through your 24x7 portal. I need someone to contact me asap or give me the email id or number that can be reached. I have received a voucher, and aince then it has been a lockdown. There is no extension for the validity, but the lockdown has extended. This was a voucher initiated instead of a refund. Please contact me asap.",1,0,2020-05-04 10:41:11,"Hi, sorry for the inconvenience caused.

Google Play,Goibibo,A Google user,horrible..travel cash ..its just a scam... just waste of time....you have to keep the app open all the time and answer questions to earn travel cash and once you have done that aftr spending hours on this stupid app...and if you try to book hotel..they will increase the hotel price so much that all the travel cash will go waste...its like for a 10 rupee product ..first they will.give you 5rs coupon and increase the product price to 25...so not only you pay more but also waste so much time....,1,12,2019-04-30 08:31:20,Hi - Please note that prices are dynamic in nature.

Google Play,Goibibo,VJ,"===== Highly NOT Recommended ===== Worst customer service in the name of covid. It's been 6 months customer care is fooling around for. I have registered my issue 100 times using every possible medium but customer care is just marking the tickets resolved without moving a needle and telling lies every time. In total in invested 30+ hours and my issue is still not resolved. The self-serve forms never work. Worst experience in this digital age. Forced to do this, a few more to follow!",1,1,2020-09-22 11:11:18,Hi. Can you please share the details of the issue at goibibo.com/support so that we can check and assist you in a better way.

Google Play,Goibibo,Divya Kumar,In fact I have 02 such cases where the flights have been cancelled by the Airline. I have tried my level best to get my money back from Goibibo but unfortunately couldn't get the same where as more than one year has been passed. Now I have decided to go for a legal case. This company doesn't disclose any contact number or mail Id where customers can express their views or problems. I will file a legal case in Cosumer FORUM to take my money back.,1,0,2020-10-17 15:12:42,Thank you for reaching out to us.

Google Play,Goibibo,A Google user,I have been using this app actively for last 4 to 5 years. Last week for the first time i raised a support ticket (other than transactional ones) for help and was very dissatisfied and dissapointed with response and actions. Felt there is no point in being loyal to this platform for so long as they do not seem to care or bothered. They do not understand the value of loosing customer loyalty and future business.,1,6,2019-01-15 23:53:36,Hi Amit - We request you to kindly share your concern in detail with us on our support service https://www.goibibo.com/support/ so that we can check and assist accordingly.
